# AC Take Home Exercise

> _All is quiet save for the waves lapping the sides of the hull and a drunken sailor muddling his way through a ballad. You feel the humming energy of the Great Stones calling out to you nearby. There is nothing to stop you now._ 

For this exercise, I've created a mini-game that takes place below the deck of a sailing ship, out on the open ocean under the full moon. You find yourself in the hold, surrounded by cargo. See if you can recover all of your lost stones of power.

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open in Unity (version 6.0).
3. For the best experience:
   1. Connect headphones/turn on volume.
   2. Connect a mouse.
   2. Set the Aspect Ratio of the Game Window to 16:9 if it isn't already.
4. Press play, then click somewhere inside the Game Window to lock the cursor to the camera.

### CONTROLS
1. Mouse to look around.
2. WASD to move.
3. Click + hold, drag & release the Left Mouse Button to interact with cargo.

### Notes

With the time I had, I did my best to focus on adding elements that contributed directly to the fun. When presented with technical choices between building something conveniently coupled versus built to last, I opted for the short-term benefits. I tried to adopt a prototype/hackathon/game jam mindset, in terms of code quality and patterns, so I could spend more time on the look and feel. I had fun fun tinkering around with this - thanks for the opportunity to share my work!
