# AC Take Home Exercise

> _All is quiet save for the waves lapping the sides of the hull and a drunken sailor muddling his way through a ballad. You feel the humming energy of the Great Stones calling out to you nearby. There is nothing to stop you now._

For this exercise, I've created a mini-game that takes place below the deck of a sailing ship, out on the open ocean under the full moon. You find yourself in the dimly lit hold, surrounded by cargo. See if you can recover all of your lost stones of power.

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open in Unity (version 6.0).
3. For the best experience:
   1. Connect headphones/turn on volume.
   2. Connect a mouse.
   2. Set the Aspect Ratio of the Game Window to 16:9 (if it isn't already).
4. Press play, then click somewhere inside the Game Window to lock the cursor to the camera.

### CONTROLS
1. Mouse to look around.
2. WASD to move.
3. Click + hold, drag & release the Left Mouse Button to interact with the cargo.

### Notes

With the time I had, I did my best to focus on implementing things that contributed directly to the fun. For example, when presented with technical choices between building something conveniently coupled versus verbose but built to last, I opted for those short-term benefits. I tried to adopt a prototype/hackathon/game jam mindset in terms of coding patterns, so I could spend more time on the look and feel. I'd be happy to chat through these tradeoffs in more detail. I also leaned into the invitation to use free assets (see full list below). While I was ultimately happy with what I sourced, I often find it tempting to roll my own version of something. It can be so rewarding to have the opportunity to pick up new skills or make something unique that's just right for your game. But it's of course important to find the balance - there's no need to reinvent the wheel, especially if it gets in the way of reaching deadlines. I had a lot of fun tinkering around with this - thanks for the opportunity to share!
